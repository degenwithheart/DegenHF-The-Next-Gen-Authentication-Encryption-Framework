Title: Design Specification for a Universal ECC-Based Security Package

---

## Overview
Develop a cross-framework, cross-language security package similar to bcrypt or SHA512, but powered by Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The package will handle user and system authentication, password hashing, token signing, and secure session management without being tied to blockchain use cases.

---

## Objective
Create a robust, lightweight, and modular security system that uses elliptic curve mathematics for one-way hashing and encryption, offering superior security to traditional hash-based systems while remaining compatible with modern web frameworks and APIs.

---

## Core Concept: ECC-Derived Hashing and Authentication

### The Core Equation
y² = x³ + ax + b (mod p)
where a and b are constants such that 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0.

We define a custom elliptic curve with unique constants to ensure a non-singular curve, creating a distinct cryptographic identity for this system.

---

## ECC Hashing Mechanism (Password + Salt)

1. Generate a random salt.
2. Combine the password and salt to form a single byte stream.
3. Apply SHA-512 to derive a private scalar k.
4. Perform point multiplication on the curve: P = k × G.
5. Compress point P (x, y) into a compact binary format.
6. Store as a bcrypt-style string:
   $ecchash$curve=custom25519$salt=[base64]$hash=[base64]

### Verification
Recompute k and P from the input password and compare the resulting hash.

## Security Design Goals

| Feature | Benefit |
|----------|----------|
| ECC Discrete Logarithm | Mathematically infeasible to reverse |
| Finite Field Mapping | Adds structural complexity |
| Hybrid Hash Option | Supports ECC+SHA512 or ECC+Argon2 |
| Non-Blockchain Usage | Focused on auth, session, and token systems |
| Portable | Compatible across frameworks (Python, Go, Rust, etc.) |

---

## Package Modules

### 1. ecc_core
Handles low-level ECC operations:
- Point addition, doubling, multiplication
- Curve validation
- Custom parameter loading

### 2. ecc_hash
High-level API for password hashing and verification:
- `hash_password(password)`
- `verify_password(password, stored_hash)`

### 3. ecc_token
ECC-based JWT-like signing:
- `sign_token(payload)`
- `verify_token(token)`

### 4. ecc_session
Session key management:
- ECDH shared secret generation
- Symmetric AES key derivation

### 5. ecc_utils
- Random salt generator
- Curve compression utilities
- Key export/import functions

---

## Integration Examples

### Python (Django/Flask)
```python
from ecc_auth import hash_password, verify_password

hash = hash_password("hunter2")
verify_password("hunter2", hash)
```

### Go (Gin/Echo)
```go
import "eccauth"

hash := eccauth.HashPassword("hunter2")
valid := eccauth.VerifyPassword("hunter2", hash)
```

### Node.js (Express/Nest)
```js
import { hashPassword, verifyPassword } from 'ecc-auth';

const hash = await hashPassword('hunter2');
const isValid = await verifyPassword('hunter2', hash);
```

---

## Technical Details

### Supported Curves
- Custom25519 (based on 2^255 - 19)
- CustomP256 (based on NIST P-256)
- Configurable parameters (a, b, p, G)

### Hash Algorithms
- SHA-512 (default)
- Argon2 (optional hybrid mode)

### Output Format
`$ecchash$curve=[name]$salt=[b64]$hash=[b64]$algo=[sha512|argon2]`

## Integration Targets

| Language | Frameworks |
|-----------|-------------|
| Go | Gin, Echo, Revel |
| Python | Django, Flask, FastAPI |
| JS/TS | Express, Next, Nest |
| Java | Spring Boot, Jakarta EE |
| C# | ASP.NET Core, .NET |
| Ruby | Rails, Sinatra |
| PHP | Laravel, Symfony |
| Rust | Rocket, Actix |
| Kotlin | Ktor, Spring Boot |
| Swift | Vapor, Kitura |

---

## Advanced Features (Future)
- Multi-factor ECC key challenge
- Biometric → ECC hash binding
- Token revocation via ECC signature chains
- Hardware key integration (YubiKey, TPM)

---

## Deliverables
1. Core ECC library (shared math layer)
2. Language bindings (Python, Go, Rust)
3. Unified API reference
4. CLI for password/token management
5. Integration examples for each major web framework

---

## Security Considerations
- Custom curve parameters must pass non-singularity test.
- Side-channel attack resistance (constant-time ops).
- Secure salt and random key generation.
- Compatible with TLS ECC suites.

---

## Expected Outcome
A universal ECC-based security library that replaces traditional hashing systems (bcrypt, SHA512) with elliptic curve transformations, enhancing password protection and token integrity across modern backend frameworks.
