auth = EccAuthHandler()

# Register user
user_id = auth.register('username', 'password123')

# Authenticate
token = auth.authenticate('username', 'password123')

# Verify token
user_data = auth.verify_token(token)
```

- ✅ **Implementation Security**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- ✅ **Operational Security**: Secure key management and monitoring
- ✅ **Human Factors**: Developer education and best practices

**Real security requires all layers working together.**

## 🧠 Overview

DegenHF provides a **universal authentication layer** that leverages **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** combined with **modern hash algorithms** (Argon2, BLAKE3).  
It’s framework-agnostic and blockchain-independent — focused purely on **secure user authentication**, **token management**, and **session security**.

**Use it standalone** for complete ECC-powered auth, or **enhance existing systems** by protecting high-security routes with blockchain-grade cryptography.

## ⚙️ Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Hybrid Cryptography** | Combines ECC secp256k1 with Argon2+BLAKE3 for resilient, GPU-hard security. |
| **Unified Auth System** | JWT-based authentication with ECC-signed tokens and session management. |
| **Cross-Language Portability** | Consistent API across Python, JavaScript, Java, and PHP frameworks. |
| **Performance Optimized** | LRU caching, constant-time operations, and async support. |
| **Zero Blockchain Dependency** | Uses the math behind crypto — not the chain. |

## 🧩 Architecture

### 1. **ECC Core Engine**
Implements secure elliptic curve operations:
- ECC secp256k1 key pair generation
- ECDSA signature creation and verification
- Constant-time cryptographic operations
- Thread-safe concurrent operations

### 2. **Hash Layer (HF)**
Hybrid password hashing system using ECC + Argon2 + BLAKE3.

**Process:**
1. Generate secure random salt
2. Argon2 password hashing (configurable iterations)
3. Additional BLAKE3 hashing for extra security
4. ECC key derivation and signing
5. Output structured hash format

### 3. **Auth Layer**
Handles:
- User registration and authentication
- JWT token creation with ES256 signing
- Token verification and validation
- Session management with secure keys

### 4. **Caching Layer**
Performance optimizations:
- LRU cache for token verification (5-minute TTL)
- Configurable cache sizes and timeouts
- Thread-safe cache operations
