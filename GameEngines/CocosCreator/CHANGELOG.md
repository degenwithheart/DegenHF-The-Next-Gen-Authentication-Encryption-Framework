and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **Initial Release**: Complete ECC authentication system for Cocos Creator
- **ECCAuthHandler.js**: Core ECC cryptography implementation with secp256k1 curve
- **AuthExtension.js**: Cocos Creator component wrapper for easy integration
- **AuthDemo.js**: Sample authentication script with UI integration
- **AuthDemoScene.js**: Complete demo scene showing authentication flow
- **AuthTestSuite.js**: Comprehensive test suite for validation
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation and usage guide
- **package.json**: Package configuration for easy installation
- **.gitignore**: Build artifact and temporary file exclusions

### Features
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**: JavaScript implementation of secp256k1 ECC
- **PBKDF2 Password Hashing**: Configurable iterations for secure password storage
- **JWT-like Token System**: Secure authentication tokens with expiration
- **Session Management**: Persistent sessions across game restarts
- **Component Integration**: Native Cocos Creator component system support

- **Async Operations**: Promise-based asynchronous authentication
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on all Cocos Creator supported platforms
- **Data Persistence**: Secure local storage with configurable paths
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Technical Details
- **Crypto Implementation**: Simplified ECC for JavaScript/browser compatibility
- **Hash Algorithm**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256 for password security
- **Token Format**: Custom JWT-like structure with ECC signatures
- **Storage**: localStorage with optional encryption
- **Session Security**: Unique session IDs with user association
- **Component Architecture**: Extends cc.Component for seamless integration

### API Methods
- User registration with ECC key generation
- User authentication with password verification
- Token generation and verification
- Session creation and validation
- Data persistence and recovery
- Logout and cleanup operations

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite covering all functionality
- Unit tests for crypto operations

- Data persistence testing

### Documentation
- Complete API reference
- Installation and setup guide
- Usage examples and best practices
- Troubleshooting section
- Performance considerations
- Security notes and limitations

### Compatibility
- **Cocos Creator**: 3.0.0+
- **Platforms**: Web, Android, iOS, Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Browsers**: Modern browsers with crypto API support
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ features required

### Known Limitations
- Simplified ECC implementation for JavaScript compatibility
- localStorage security depends on platform
- Some platforms may have limited crypto API support
- No server-side validation (client-side only)

### Future Plans
- Enhanced cryptographic strength with native libraries
- Server-side authentication integration
- OAuth and social login support
- Multi-factor authentication
- Offline authentication caching

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Simplified ECC**: Chose simplified implementation over complex libraries for better compatibility
- **Component Wrapper**: Created component layer for easier Cocos Creator integration
- **Event System**: Implemented event-driven approach for flexible UI integration
- **Promise-based**: Used modern async/await patterns for better code readability

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing with configurable iterations
- Token expiration to prevent replay attacks
- Session-based authentication for temporary access
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure key generation and storage

### Performance Optimizations
- Asynchronous crypto operations to prevent UI blocking
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Efficient localStorage usage
- Memory cleanup on component destruction
