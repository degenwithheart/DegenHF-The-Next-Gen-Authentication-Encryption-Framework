- **Cloud Sync**: Cross-device authentication state synchronization
- **Advanced Crypto**: Post-quantum cryptography options
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and profiling tools

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **OpenSSL Integration**: Chose OpenSSL for mature, cross-platform crypto implementation
- **SDL2 UI Framework**: Selected SDL2 for broad platform support and game development focus
- **JSON Persistence**: Used nlohmann/json for human-readable, portable data storage
- **Mutex Protection**: Implemented thread safety for potential server/multiplayer use
- **Callback System**: Used std::function for flexible, type-safe event handling

### Security Considerations
- **Cryptographic Agility**: Designed for easy upgrade to newer algorithms
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage with proper encoding
- **Token Security**: Short-lived tokens with cryptographic signatures
- **Session Tracking**: Activity-based session management to prevent stale sessions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation to prevent injection attacks

### Performance Optimizations

- **Asynchronous Crypto**: Non-blocking cryptographic operations where possible
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized SDL2 rendering with texture caching
- **Memory Pool**: Reuse of UI component resources
- **Lock Optimization**: Minimal critical sections to reduce contention

### Build System
- **CMake Configuration**: Cross-platform build with dependency detection
- **Package Config**: CMake package configuration for easy integration
- **Installation Support**: Standard CMake install targets
- **Example Projects**: Separate build targets for examples and tests
